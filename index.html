        <p class="main-text">I'm an internationally published, award winning photographer and multi-instrumentalist residing in 
            Richmond, VA. I have a Bachelor of Arts in Music (Specification in Audio Engineering and Digital Recording) and a Minor in 
            Creative Advertising from Virginia Commonwealth University. In 2006, I founded Fire At Will Photography. Since its inception, I have been published in the US, 
            UK and Russia by Rolling Stone, MSN, Buzzfeed and more. In 2015, I received the Mark of Excellence Award by the Society of 
            Professional Journalists at the University of Maryland for best supporting photo in a publication.
            In 2013, I cofounded Greyskull Studios, a music recording studio based in Colonial Heights, Virginia.</p><br>
            <p class="main-text">From 2015-2016, I served as the Primary Educator at Longwood University's Center for the Visual Arts, 
            where I expanded the ArtKids program, a special outreach program that teaches photography to gifted and at-risk fourth 
            graders at Cumberland County Elementary School and Prince Edward County Elementary School. In 2016, I founded The 
            Cold Collective, a multimedia group and artist community dedicated to bridging the gap between the fragmented 
            and compartmentalized art and music scenes of central Virginia.</p>
            ​<p class="main-text">I'm changing gears to a career in coding because the future isn't going to build and program itself. I am currently
            a student at University of Richmond's Coding Bootcamp and teach music lessons on oboe, saxophone and piano.</p><br>
