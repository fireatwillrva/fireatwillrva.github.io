      <p>I'm an internationally published, award winning photographer and multi-instrumentalist residing in 
        Richmond, VA. I have a B.A. in Music (Specification in Audio Engineering and Digital Recording) and a Minor in 
        Creative Advertising from VCU. In 2006, I founded Fire At Will Photography. Since its inception, I have been published in the US, 
        UK and Russia by Rolling Stone, MSN, Buzzfeed and more. In 2015, I received the Mark of Excellence Award by the Society of 
        Professional Journalists at the University of Maryland for best supporting photo in a publication.</p>
        
        <p>From 2015-2016, I served as the Primary Educator at Longwood University's Center for the Visual Arts, 
        where I expanded the ArtKids program, a special outreach program that teaches photography to gifted and at-risk fourth 
        graders. I am currently a student at University of Richmond's Coding Bootcamp and teach music lessons on oboe, saxophone and piano.
        I'm changing gears to a career in coding because the future isn't going to build and program itself.</p>
